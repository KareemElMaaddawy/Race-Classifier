# APS360-Project

The goal of this project was to be able to reliably estimate the race of a human given their picture. The model should be able to predict the race from one of five classes which care White, Black, Middle Eastern, Asian and Indian.

The project comprises of two models. First being the VGG transfer learning model which uses pre-trained features that is fed into an ANN classifier. The second model was a CNN model that is 11 layers deep. The first 8 layers are convolutional (feature extractors) while the last 3 are fully-connected linear layers (classifiers).
